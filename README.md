## 🧠 What Is a Schedule Trainer?

A **Schedule Trainer** is a cheat-style utility that manipulates time-based systems in games. It gives you tools to **reset cooldowns**, **skip in-game clocks**, **loop daily tasks**, and **trigger events** that would normally require real or simulated time.

It works great in both **offline and semi-online games**, especially those built on cycles, rotations, and lock timers.
